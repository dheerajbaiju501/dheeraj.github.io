We introduce RealPC, a real-world industrial point cloud dataset with paired complete and incomplete scans, captured under challenging, uncontrolled conditions. RealPC differs from synthetic datasets in terms of noise, non-uniformity, and richer topological features, as shown through topological data analysis. Standard completion models perform poorly on it, highlighting a gap in existing methods. To tackle this, we propose BOSHNet, a simple network that extracts multi-scale skeletal priors inspired by 0D persistent homology to guide shape completion from early training.
