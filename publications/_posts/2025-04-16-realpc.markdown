We present RealPC, a large-scale real-world industrial point cloud dataset with paired scans of incomplete and complete objects, captured in challenging, uncontrolled multi-sensor environments. Unlike synthetic datasets, RealPC features significant noise, non-uniformity, and rich topological structures revealed via topological data analysis (TDA). Benchmarking shows that existing completion methods perform poorly on this data, exposing a gap in current approaches. To address this, we propose BOSHNet, a lightweight model that extracts multi-scale skeletal priors inspired by 0D persistent homology, guiding the network from early training toward structurally accurate completions.
