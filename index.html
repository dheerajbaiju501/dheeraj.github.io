            I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/about/bits-foundation/">BITS Pilani</a>, majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Currently, I am working as a Software Development Intern at <a href="https://tech.myntra.com/">Myntra</a> on the Cart & Wishlist Team.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have collaborted with <a href="https://prashkmr.github.io/about/">Prashant Kumar</a> on research in Topological Deep Learning
            and worked with <a href="https://soumyasanyal.github.io/">Soumya Sanyal</a> on calibrating large language models for long-form question-answering prompts.
            I also had the opportunity to work under <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/tejasvi-alladi/">Prof. Tejasvi Alladi</a>, where I focused on optimizing the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm for vehicular networks.
            Additionally, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=huBdrDMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Satyam Srivastava</a> on multi-label classificaton and segmentation of cancerous tumors.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            I'm broadly interested in Deep Learning , with a specific focus on Multimodal Models and Interpretability.
            I'm particularly interested in foundation models that learn from multiple modalities, and in making their predictions more transparent and aligned with human reasoning.
